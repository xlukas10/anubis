		<h2><a id="Previewwindow">Preview window</a></h2>
		
			<p>In the top right part of the application window area for
			live preview is located. Once you start receiving frames from 
			camera, they will appear there. If you have image zoomed in you
			can click and drag to move freely around the picture or you can 
			use the scroll bars.</p>
			
			<img src="preview.png">
		<h2><a id="Controlelements">Control elements</a></h2>
		
			<p>To control camera, you need to use buttons located under the preview window. Purpose of individual buttons will be explained shortly.</p>

			<img src="control_btns.png">
			
			<p>The Start/Stop preview will start getting new images from the camera
			in a continuous way. If you get only one frame or none at all, 
			check if you have continuous acquisition mode set in the <a href="#Configuringcamera">camera 
			configuration</a></p>
			
			<p>Using Single frame, the camera will send one frame and it 
			will be displayed in the preview area.</p>
			
			<p>The Start/Stop recording will do the same thing as starting 
			preview, however in addition the frames will be saved to your
			hard drive. Save location and duration is set up in <a href="#Settinguprecording">Configure 
			recoding</a> tab, however you can always stop recording 
			prematurely.</p>
			
			<p>Zoom buttons only affects the preview window and not the 
			frames saved. Zoom in and Zoom out buttons are self-explanatory,
			Fit to window will make sure that the image will always fill all
			the available area without changing the aspect ratio of the image. 
			Zoom to 100% will show the image in 1:1 pixel ratio (real size).</p>

		<h2><a id="Connectingcamera">Connecting camera</a></h2>
		
			<h3>Adding transport layer file</h3>
				<p>Before you can search for your camera, you need to add GenTL
				transport layer file (.cti). These files are usually a part of 
				camera vendor SDK or camera software. It is recommended to use
				transport layer file directly from the camera vendor, however
				different files may sometimes work as well. Note that you can 
				add as many transport layer files as you want but in that case
				some devices may be found multiple times.</p>
				
				<img src="add_cti.png">
				

			<h3>Saving transport layer files configuration</h3>
				<p>If you do not want to search for .cti files manually
				every time you start the application, you can save active 
				configuration in the file menu as shown in the picture below.</p>

			<img src="save_cti.png">
			
			<h3>Connecting camera</h3>
				<p>Now that you have transport layer ready, you can proceed 
				to searching for cameras. Simply click the refresh button and
				wait for application to search for devices (red).</p>
				
				<img src="connect.png">
				
				<p>In the list you can select the camera and click connect or
				alternatively you can double click the listing you want to 
				connect to (blue). After the camera is connected, the listing should
				turn green, and the camera should be listed in the status bar
				in the bottom of the application window.</p>
			
			<h3>Disconnecting camera</h3>
				<p>To disconnect the camera simply click disconnect button
				in the connect camera tab. Note that if you refresh cameras
				and connect to a new one, the current camera will be 
				disconnected automatically.</p>

		<h2><a id="Configuringcamera">Configuring camera</a></h2>
		
			<img src="configure.png">
			
			<p>In this tab you can do all the configuration of the camera you
			need. In the top portion of the tab, there is a configuration 
			level selector with three levels (beginner, expert and guru) 
			based on the selection, some features may or may not be available
			to you. You can modify the parameters as you like, but numerical 
			features have some limits in most cases and you won’t be allowed
			to put higher or lower numbers in. If you want to change the 
			parameter simply input number or text and hit enter. For 
			enumeration, command and Boolean features you just need to change
			the value and the feature will be changed without hitting enter.</p>
			
			<p>To save the configuration or load it back to the camera, you 
			can use buttons in the lower part of the tab. Note that the 
			configuration files are device dependent and cannot be 
			transferred between different camera models, sometimes not even
			between different devices of the same model.</p>
			
		<h2><a id="Settinguprecording">Setting up recording</a></h2>
		
		<img src="recording.png">
		
			<p>If you want to properly save frames to the hard drive, you 
			will need to set up this tab. First you need to specify a file 
			name without extension as the application only saves .png images (yellow field).
			You can input any string into the file name field but cannot 
			input characters that are not supported for file names in the 
			Windows ( ^\ /:*?"&lt; &gt;|). As you can see in the tip, you can 
			add %n to number saved frames and %d to add a time stamp. If you 
			do not add %n, the application will automatically save the images
			with (%n) to make sure they will not overwrite themselves.</p>
			
			<p>In the next text field you need to specify saving location 
			either by hand or you can use a file dialog opened by the Save
			Location button (blue field). If you leave this field empty, the frames will
			be saved into the application directory. If the selected folder 
			does not exist, it will be created.</p>
			
			<p>Sequence duration let’s you set time in seconds you want the 
			recording to last (green field). If you want to control the recording manually,
			you can set it to 0. Note that you can always stop the recording
			manually even before the set up time passes.</p>
			
			<p>All these settings can be saved to application inner 
			configuration file using Save settings or resetted using Default
			settings. If you save the settings the application will load them
			automatically at the start of the program (red field).</p>
			
		<h2><a id="Usingartificialneuralnetworks">Using artificial neural networks</a></h2>
		
			<img src="tensorflow.png">
			<p>This tab’s purpose is to allow you to train your tensorflow 
			model created using Keras API and to test its response on the 
			live camera feed. In order to use this tab you first need to 
			load the model folder using Load Model button and then navigating
			using a file dialog. When you finish training, you can also save 
			the model as a new directory using Save model button (yellow field).</p>
			
			<p>As you can see in the picture above, this tab has two separate
			options one for training the network and the other for live
			classification (green field).</p>
			
			<h3><a id="Classification">Classification</a></h3>
			
				<p>This tab’s behavior is autonomous and whenever you have 
				both camera connected and model loaded you will be able to 
				see results of the prediction in the graph as in picture
				below. As of now, you need to know which category belongs to
				which output as Keras does not save category names along with
				the model nor does the Tensorflow. As some model can have
				hundreds of categories, which would be very hard to read, the
				application shows only up to 5 categories with the highest 
				activation for given image. If you have model set up to 
				output one-hot encoded activation, the graph will show only 
				the category with strongest activation and one of the other 
				categories which all have activation 0 or another constant.</p>
			
			<h3><a id="Training">Training</a></h3>
			
				<p>To be able to train the model you need a dataset. This 
				dataset must have folder structure as shown on the figure 
				below. Bear in mind that the categories (represented by 
				subdirectories) will be treated in alphabetical order. It is 
				recommended to name them 0-n where n is number of categories 
				in the model. If for example you have a model with 4 
				categories, you should create directories named 0,1,2 and 3.
				Even if you don’t have any data for some of the categories.</p>
				
				<img src="dataset_structure.png" height="700">
				
				<p>After your dataset is ready you can select it using file
				dialog or paste a path directly (blue field).</p>
				
				<p>After clicking load Data, the dataset will be loaded to 
				the memory and resized to fit your model’s needs. </p>
				
				<p>When the data is loaded, you can set up validation split 
				and number of training epochs and then start the training (magenta field). 
				You will see that beside simple progress bar you can track 
				the network’s performance during training (cyan field). If you are not 
				satisfied with the results after the training completes, you 
				can run it again on the same dataset or load a new one. It is
				recommended to save the network after each training so you 
				will not lose the progress in case your network will be 
				overfit.</p>

			<h3>File</h3>
				<p>Save camera config and Load camera config should only be 
				used when the camera is connected and their behavior is the 
				same as described <a href="#Configuringcamera">here</a>. The same goes for <a href="#Connectingcamera">add.cti file 
				and remove .cti file.</a> If you want to save application config 
				including transport layer file paths, you need to click Save 
				app state.</p>
				
			<h3>Help</h3>
				<p>Open help will take you to this web help. About Anubis 
				contains informations about application itself and Git 
				Repository will take you to a <a href="https://github.com/xlukas10/anubis" target="_blank">Github page</a> of this program, 
				where you can find the newest versions as well as submit 
				bugs or feature requests.</p>
				
		<h2><a id="StatusBar">Status Bar</a></h2>
		
			<img src="status_bar.png">
		
			<p>In the bottom part of the application is a status bar. The left
			side shows last action either for a few seconds or until a 
			new status update is called. </p>
			
			<p>The middle part shows active camera with three color coded 
			states. Grey circle means that the camera is not connected, 
			green light represents connected camera ready to receive 
			instructions and finally red light means that the camera is 
			busy receiving frames.</p>
			
			<p>On the very right is an information about frames received in 
			this session as well as current frames per second</p>
